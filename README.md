============

Source for CSUN demonstration.  Mostly concentrating on UI features of AngularJs.

Directories 'ex1...' through 'ex5...' contain examples of AngularJs techniques, some of which have accessibility issues.

Directories 'accessible-form' & 'aria-live' contain examples of fixing some common accessibility issues.

You can open the index file and play with these directly by going to:

Feel free to use these.  I would recommend also trying out the official tutorial at:
